Examples include those of witches who suck people's blood till the victims are dead, or who fly out at night in the form of spir spirits to visit and kill victims and who sometimes claim to be responsible for grave disasters like fatal accidents, deaths of great men, insanity of student sons/daughters of rivals.

This disorderly \"news conference\" is usually attended by people of all ages with keen interest. The venue is not specially arranged, but the confessor usually sits in front of a house, in a public place like a round-about, market place, or side of a street. The confession usually goes thus \"Do you know why it took the son of Mr. X twelve years to accomplish his university course which should normally take only three years? I am the one who kept sucking his brain and seeing to it that he failed his examination each time. I was the one who killed my first daughter last year when she died during labour. I warned Mr. Z not to buy a new car but to try to make his bicycle do. He ignored my warning and bought the car. He did not know he was doomed by doing this. It was on the","occasion of the wedding of his sister he got into the car and began to ride to the Church, but on the way I slapped him and pushed his car to make it crash into that bridge near the Church, tumbling into the river. He, his mother-in-law and the new car met their end that fateful morning. My listeners, I hope the event is still fresh in your memories\". A confessor is sometimes given a white fowl which she/he holds during the confession. A confessor usually dies soon after the confession, though some survive."]}},"variations":[]}],"saà":[{"wordClass":"interjection/interrogative","definitions":["exclamation of displeasure; Shut up!
